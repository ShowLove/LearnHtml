				<div class="entry-content">
				<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><a href="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/sandy1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image aligncenter" id="i-325" style="border:4px solid black;" alt="Image" src="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/sandy1.jpg?w=650&#038;h=394" width="650" height="394" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Sandy&#8217;s Aftermath</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center"><strong></strong>We all know about superstorm Sandy.  We&#8217;ve seen the pictures.  We&#8217;ve heard the stories.  A lot of us have probably felt the effect and are STILL feeling the effects of the devastation.  It will take years and billions of dollars to restore all that was lost in her aftermath, and even then, some things will never be the same.  As a boater though, what does that mean for us?</p>
<p>Well there is always the obvious hundreds of thousands of boats that were damaged and destroyed by high winds, flooding, rain, looting, and lack of adequate preparation.  If your boat was tied down really well, it may be been flooded.  If it wasn&#8217;t tied down well, then it probably ended up on top of another boat.  If it was dry-docked, the building probably crashed down on it.  If it survived the storm, it was probably a victim of theft.  There’s no shortage to the stories we&#8217;ve heard about the loss people have experienced.</p>
<p>Then there is the insurance headache and surge of boat sales.  When you were finally able to get to or find your boat, you had to deal with the insurance companies and claims.  Take photos.  Document what was on the boat.  Provide evidence of what is missing off the boat.  Work with already overwhelmed and exhausted agents who are trying to get homes for people before replacing your &#8220;toy.&#8221;  If you were lucky enough to have everything handy and get it in early, you may be holding on to a nice chunk of change and contemplating a new boat purchase.  Which brings us to our next set of issues.</p>
<p>A huge increase in the resale of salvaged boats!  Many people are fixing up the boats and trying to resell without documenting the boats damage.  A little bit of fiberglass and some good cleaning agents and the boat is looking better than new.  However, underneath everything, the stress cracks grow bigger, the mold continues to build and the integrity of the boat continues to slip away.  How do you know if the boat is worth what it&#8217;s being sold for?  How do you know it&#8217;s safe?  How do you know it hasn&#8217;t been flooded?</p>
<p>And if you get past all of those hurdles, what will you do differently with your boat this time?  Will you store it in the water?  Will you dry dock it again?  If you are going to dry dock it, where?  Many of the marinas and storage areas have been destroyed and they have made the decision NOT to rebuild.  If they are rebuilding, it&#8217;ll be a while before they are ready for more boats.</p>
<p>And lastly, where did all of the debris go from the storm?  Oh that&#8217;s right- into our waterways.  Is it even safe to boat in the area right now?  Have they been able to clean up the oceans/lakes floors?  What submerged item will you hit?  What contamination is in the water that could cause harm to your family if you are swimming or fishing?</p>
<p>Typically following a storm like this, boat sales increase significantly as people whose boats survived the storm try to sell and people who have insurance checks try to upgrade.   The remainder of this year might be an extraordinary time to buy a new boat because there will be a surplus of them on the market.  And just because a boat has been swamped or considered a salvage does not mean the boat should be not be considered.  These days repairs can make a boat better than new!  Now is definitely the time to buy a used boat.  You&#8217;ll get a much larger boat, or better manufacturer than if you tried to buy a new boat.  Just make sure you are taking every precaution to ensure that the boat you are looking at is safe for your family and friends.  Do the research.  Ask questions about the history.  Run a <a href="http://www.boathistoryreport.com" target="_blank">Boat History Report </a>on it.  Get a <a href="http://www.namsglobal.org/" target="_blank">NAMS</a> certified surveyor to inspect it and inform them that the boat may have been a storm victim.  As long as you&#8217;re smart about your purchase, you could end up with the deal of the year on the gem of the sea!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Fo</strong><strong>ur Sites Making Waves for Summer</strong></p>
<p>There are a million different boating sites out there for all of your needs.  We found 4 must have sites for this summer though- and we promise you won’t be disappointed!</p>
<p>A new up and coming business that we&#8217;ve all been waiting for is <a href="http://www.boatsgo.com" target="_blank">BoatsGo.com</a>.   With all of the daily deal sites out there, it’s about time someone created one specifically designed for boaters!  BoatsGo does just that, offering deals on products, services, labor and events (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMSL4mLjwtw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMSL4mLjwtw</a>).  BoatsGo is just getting started in South Florida but is rapidly working on expansion. BoatsGo creator, Stephen Munive created the site because  “Boaters are very passionate and social. And, since boating is not an inexpensive hobby, most boaters are always looking for a way to save some money, so they can spend more time on the water.”    As a bonus for BoatHistoryReport.com members, they are offering a special $10 credit to your<a href="http://www.boatsgo.com" target="_blank"> BoatsGo</a> account when you sign up. Use the promo code (BHR13), which is good towards purchases on BoatsGo. Register here to take advantage of this offer: <a href="http://boatsgo.com/user/signup">http://boatsgo.com/user/signup</a>.</p>
<p>Why do we like it?  With all of the costs associated with boating, a little break here and there is much appreciated!   You never know what deal you’ll see come through the website!</p>
<p>Another website you’ll want to check out is the <a href="http://www.allianceforsafenavigation.org/" target="_blank">Alliance</a>.  A nonprofit company, the <a href="http://www.allianceforsafenavigation.org/" target="_blank">Alliance </a>was formed through the collaboration of 6 individual marine companies looking to make boating safer for all.  They make it easy to get updated chart information and connect with the people that can help.  One particular partner in the Alliance, <a href="http://www.oceangrafix.com/" target="_blank">OceanGrafix</a>, is one of the leading providers of marine navigation charts and works closely with <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NOAA</a> to ensure every chart is up-to-date at all times.  One of the most critical items for any boater, especially with the influx of debris littering our waterway floors from storms and runoffs, is an updated chart of your planned course.  This is an ESSENTIAL FIRST STOP when preparing for boating season this summer.   Updating your charts can save not only your boat, but your life as well.  Please make this a must before hitting the waves.</p>
<p>Why do we like it?  We all have that friend that still uses paper charts from 1973 but it’s time to frame and display the ole paper page.  Besides, we don’t want him missing out on buried treasure from 1984!   Let’s keep him, as well as ourselves a little safer on the water.</p>
<p>If you are in the process of buying a boat, there are a surplus of classified sites at your disposal.  One of our favorites is <a href="http://www.boatingbay.com" target="_blank">BoatingBay</a>.  Founded in 2006, Christopher Bailey has quickly made <a href="http://www.boatingbay.com" target="_blank">BoatingBay.com</a> one of the largest networks in the USA with over 60,000 boats for sale.   With prompt customer service and ease of use, the site provides fast, easy and FREE ways to search for new and used boats.  The site is also optimized for the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices which is ideal for people on the move.  If you are shopping for a boat in your local area, the “Quick Boat Finder” automatically and quickly finds boats for sale based on your physical location without having to waste time manually inputting your information.  Also, for <a href="http://www.boathistoryreport.com" target="_blank">BoatHistoryReport.com</a> members, BoatingBay.com has offered a free boat listing by simply logging in under <a href="http://www.boatingbay.com/bhr">www.boatingbay.com/bhr</a>.  Definitely a great one stop shop for quick and easy boat research.</p>
<p>Why do we like it?  <a href="http://www.boatingbay.com" target="_blank">BoatingBay.com</a> has unparalleled customer service and ease of use.  The site is clean and everything you need is incredibly easy to access.  We love the drive and determination from Mr. Bailey that has quickly made this one of the best sites on the market.</p>
<p>Once you have found your perfect boat on BoatingBay, how do you know if you’re getting a good deal or not?  That’s simple-  <a href="http://www.nadaguides.com/Boats">NADAGuides.com</a>.   NADAguides is known for its comprehensive pricing guide, offering a wide range of data, products and services, informational articles, tips and advice and video buying guides.    Whether it’s a private seller or a Brokerage/Dealer, NADAguides serves to give you a great starting point in your negotiations.   As the leading provider of vehicle pricing and services, NADAguides should be an essential step in your decision making process, also giving you an idea of how well the boat will hold its value through the years.</p>
<p>Why we like it:   We have worked with <a href="http://www.nadaguides.com/Boats">NADAguides.com</a> since we first began and have enjoyed their level of professionalism and integrity.  They are the best site out there as far as pricing guides and are definitely a go-to on our list.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s summer- get out there and boat!</p>

<p>If you plan on towing your boat in and out of the water, having the proper trailer is essential.  It’s like having the proper tires on a car in the snow or on a racetrack.  If you don’t, all sorts of things can go wrong.   Buying the right trailer however is not determined by the amount of frills and bling it adds to the road but rather by a proper fit, working parts and secure hookups.  This article will give you a basic outline of things to consider when purchasing your boats “wheels.”</p>
<ol>
<li>Will you need a bunk or roller trailer?  What’s the difference?   A bunk trailer is designed for loading and unloading boats in deeper water and will need to be backed fairly far in to load your boat.  It is generally the more affordable type of trailer and is a bit easier to drive on. It is also very easy to float on, due to the deeper depth of water.   Typical reviews also suggest that bunks are easier to center your boat and provide excellent support for longer trailering distances.  A great brand, especially for salt water use, is <a href="http://www.floaton.com/">Float-On Boat Trailers</a>.  They have recently added waterproof lighting which really illuminates the boat both on the road and while loading and unloading.  Roller trailers are preferred for launching and trailering in shallower waters.  These trailers are designed for easy loading without having to submerge the trailer axels, and if properly adjusted, offer very easy drive-on drive-off capabilities.  They work well in all tide stages and distribute the boats weight over many points.    <a href="http://www.shorelandr.com/">Shoreland’r</a> offers a large selection of roller trailers for all sizes and is a very reputable company.  Make sure you check your boats warranty however- some manufacturers will void the boats warranty if a roller trailer is used as it can dimple the hull.</li>
<li>The second step is determining the length and weight of your boat for your trailer needs.  You want to error on the side of too big and strong over too small.  When considering the weight of your boat, remember to add the motor, fuel, water, batteries, gear and accessories and not just the hull weight.  Also consider your vehicles towing capacity as the weight of the trailer and fully loaded boat can add up quickly.  As far as the length, you’ll want to include the bow pulpit if your boat has one, but do not include the swim platform.  The trailers support ends at the hulls running surface.  A general rule of thumb is to purchase a trailer 2 feet longer than your boat hulls length.</li>
<li>Look for a trailer with larger tires.  The larger the tire, the longer the life of both the tire itself and the wheel bearings due to less rotations.</li>
<li>Although not all states require trailer brakes and lights, it wouldn’t be wise to not have them.  Any added protection for the motor and back end of your boat is a must.  Ensure they are designed for boat trailers (in other words, make sure they are waterproof and sealed) and check them regularly to ensure they are working properly.  The additional brakes for your trailer will help keep not only your boat safe, but you safe, as well as the other drivers around you.</li>
<li>Type of material used for the trailer is another thing to consider- If you will be using your boat in saltwater, you should only be considering aluminum or stainless steel.  Anything else will rust so fast you’ll be lucky to use it an entire season.  When I say aluminum, be sure to inspect ALL parts of the trailer.  Another option would be hot dipped galvanized steel but these can become very heavy.  Again, don’t forget to consider your vehicles towing capacity when determining which type of trailer to purchase.  Don’t go with a 3 axel if a 2 axel will do- less is more in that respect and makes maneuvering in tight spaces significantly easier.</li>
<li>There are a few add-ons you should consider if the budget allows for them.  Load guides will help you center the boat on the trailer.  A transom saver reduces engine pressure by adding additional support.  As we mentioned earlier, waterproof lights that run the length of the trailer, although not providing functionality per se, do provide pride and FUN!  A spare (or two) trailer tire is a great thing to have available as it is not safe to leave your boat and trailer on a jack road side while you drive miles to get a new tire.  You may want to add a complete correctly sized hub if space permits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Boating is an expensive hobby but well worth it if you are prepared.  Make sure you don’t neglect the trailer- it can literally make or break your day on the water!  I hope this article gave you a bit more insight on what to look for.  As always, speak with your boat manufacturer as well as a rep from the trailer companies to ensure you get the proper trailer fit and type for your boating needs.</p>

				<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">
<a href="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/p1100457.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" id="i-270" style="border:4px solid black;" alt="Image" src="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/p1100457.jpg?w=487" width="487" height="365" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">The groundhog missed his shadow- SPRING IS ON THE WAY!  Some people see picnics.  Some people see flowers.  And if you’re like me, you see boats and fish and beer and sunblock and any other number of things to do on the water!  But… lets rewind for a minute before we take off cruisin’- is your boat even ready for its glorious reunion with fresh air and wakes?  Read on to find out!</p>
<p>Of course you read our winterizing article so the answer to the above questions is YES (with just a few touchups of course).  What’s that?  You didn’t?!? Well, we hope you enjoy the embarrassment of loading your boat with friends, beer, and toys, while sitting docked and hearing nothing but the sounds of the working boats around you.  Thanks for keeping the waterways a little less crowded.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started because spring only lasts so long…</p>
<ol>
<li>CLEAN!  Just like when you put your boat away, cleaning is a critical.  Use a mild detergent or a boat cleaner and give her a good scrub down.  While you’re at it, give her a good wax job also.  It’s like applying sunscreen- protect her from UV damage or she’ll look old and used before you even take advantage of her.  If you have teak on the boat, make sure to give it a good coat of oil to keep it from blistering.  And don’t neglect the steel- it’s the perfect mirror for a quick glance at your wind battered hair when looking for next weekend’s best friend.</li>
<li>Always check your batteries!  Is there corrosion?  How are the fluid levels?  Is the battery hooked up correctly?  And is it working?  Have you charged it properly?  If the fluids are fine and there isn’t any corrosion but nothing will turn on now might be a good time to invest in a new battery.  Also, while checking on your battery, make sure to reconnect any electronics you disconnected during the winter.  You may want to use a wire brush to clean the terminals and cable ends.  Ensure that each piece of equipment is working before moving on to the next.</li>
<li>Inspect your fuel system- a half tank means half the fun.   If you drained it in the winter, make sure to check the lines for cracks, brittleness or softness.  Look for leaks and loose connections.  Verify all clamps are properly secured and change your fuel filter.  Lastly, top your tank off to avoid moisture and condensation from forming in your tank.</li>
<li> Check your belts!  Make sure they didn’t stretch with your waist line during the holidays.  Tighten belts if needed to ensure they fit tightly around pulleys, which prevents slipping.  When fitted properly, you should only be able to push the belt down slightly.  A loose fitting belt will wear faster due to increased risk of slipping.    If the belt is worn, you may notice a black substance/residue near the pulley.  If you notice cracks or swells on the outer jacket of the control cables, you’ll want to take immediate action to repair them, or you could be left up the creek with an…engine?</li>
<li> Flush the antifreeze out of the motor, fresh water systems, holding tanks, and even the loo!  Check fluid levels and re-lubricate each of these areas and fill what needs to be filled or replaced.  Don’t overlook anything as one missed reservoir is all you need to ruin your boating season.  Extra areas to make sure aren’t overlooked: engine oil, power trim reservoirs, coolant, power steering and drive lubricants.</li>
<li>Spend a little more time on the engine now that the preliminary checks are complete.  Take a look at the spark plugs- would now be a good time to replace them?  Probably.  How about the propeller- is it free of dings and pitts and fitting properly?  A damaged propeller can cause excessive vibration, damaging your drive train.  It’s not a bad idea to keep an extra propeller on hand.   Put engine muffs on and test your engine with a garden hose before taking your boat out for the first time.  Do you see a steady discharge stream?  If not, you may need to replace your water pump impeller, which is typically necessary every 2-3 years.  Lastly, don’t forget to check your filters.  Your fuel filter should already be done but how do your oil and air filters look?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few other things you should look over before launching your boat for the season:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test the bilge pump to ensure it runs properly.</li>
<li>Test the trim tabs, especially if you intend to run heavy.</li>
<li>Check to make sure all safety equipment is on board and not expired.  This includes flares, safety jackets, fire extinguisher, and distress signals.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to update your fishing and boating permits, and boat registration.</li>
<li>What are the conditions of your dock lines?  Anchor line? Bumpers?</li>
<li>Check lighting fixtures including navigational lights, and ensure you have spare bulbs just in case.</li>
<li>If you aren’t keeping your boat in the water, don’t forget to go over the trailer.  Look at the rollers and pads, lubricate the wheels and winch, test the lights and brakes and check the safety chain.</li>
</ol>
<p>This list is a great starting place for making sure you are “fun” ready, going into boating season but you should check with your manufacturer for more specific recommendations depending on the boat type, engine type and size of your vessel.  Also important to remember is how the boat will be stored during the season and what extra precautions should be taken.</p>

				<p>Boat Show season means new toys, new gadgets, new boats, and new boaters.  It brings millions of dollars to an industry that people fear is fizzling away due to cutbacks and economic crisis.  It energizes people to spend time on the water as a form of therapy and relaxation.  It stresses those same people when repairs need to be made and paid for.  It’s a love hate relationship for boaters.  Yet the fresh air and water, sea salt and fish seem to continually flow through our blood.  So despite the fact that we eat ramen noodles for dinner to be able to afford gas and beer for the boat, we get out every chance we can for a dose of “therapy.”   Why?  Because it is the one thing that calms the nerves, lowers the blood pressure, frees the spirit and releases endorphins when all else fails.  Some of you know what I am talking about.  Some of you will soon enough.  Welcome to boating!</p>
<p>This years Miami show is proving to have been a major success as the preliminary figures begin to roll in.  With a 1% increase in attendance over last year for the NMMA portion of the combined shows, vendors and exhibitors felt very pleased with the results from this years show.  Brokers and dealers alike closed on many yachts and ended the show with enough leads to keep them busy for months.  MarineMax, one of the largest brokers at the show, shared that they had results in the double digits over last years results.  The largest boat at the Sea Isle Marina was Marlow Yachts Explorer 97E which made her debut AND was spoken for by show end.   The Miami International Boat Show brings in 100,000 visitors and has an economic impact of a billion dollars for the area.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class=" wp-image aligncenter" id="i-156" title="Miami International Boat Show " alt="Image" src="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/miami-expo.jpg?w=639&#038;h=480" width="639" height="480" /></p>
<p> The Yacht and Brokerage show, produced by Show Management, which runs simultaneously with the Miami International Boat Show also showed great success.  Many companies debuted new models of yachts, and an impressive number of showings.  Ferretti Group alone had 25 yachts on display, many of which were sold by the show end, and 4 of which were debuts!  Other companies such as Benetti, who hosted the largest yacht- “Diamonds are Forever” at 200 ft, debuted at least one new model at the show.  With 4 days of perfect weather and one slightly rainy day, the Yacht and Brokerage Show was the cause for thousands of Tweets, Facebook Posts, Instagram photos and buzz- a marketing dream and a boaters paradise.  Between the two shows, the city feels the residual impact within the marine industry for months after the events take place due to the consummating of deals initiated during the show and the servicing, fitting and refitting of boats and yachts purchased during the show.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class=" wp-image aligncenter" id="i-228" alt="Image" src="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/miami125.jpg?w=522&#038;h=356" width="522" height="356" /></p>
<p> Although the Miami International Boat Show is typically thought of the world’s largest and most influential show, there are many great shows that boating enthusiasts should attend.  Some of the upcoming events include Palm Beach, nationally ranked in the top 5 shows, which takes place March 21<sup>st</sup>&#8211; March 24<sup>th</sup> in West Palm Beach, Florida.  This show takes place along the intracoastal and features more than $1.2 billion worth of boats, yachts and marine accessories.   Drawing a more sophisticated crowd due to its location and proximity to Palm Beach, this show is produced by the same company that puts on the Yacht and Brokerage Show in Miami and the Ft. Lauderdale International Boat Show. More information can be found on their site at <a href="http://www.showmanagement.com/palm-beach-boat-show/event/">http://www.showmanagement.com/palm-beach-boat-show/event/</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/palm-beach-show.png"><img class=" wp-image aligncenter" id="i-229" alt="Image" src="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/palm-beach-show.png?w=580&#038;h=395" width="580" height="395" /></a></p>
<p> Another great show every year is the Newport International Boat Show.  This show is in its 43<sup>rd</sup> year running and takes place September 12-15<sup>th</sup>.  Spanning along America’s Cup Avenue, multiple waterfront facilities will feature hundreds of boats and thousands of products and services.  For more information, check out <a href="http://www.newportboatshow.com/">http://www.newportboatshow.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/newport-show.jpg"><img class=" wp-image aligncenter" id="i-231" alt="Image" src="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/newport-show.jpg?w=639&#038;h=426" width="639" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>Annapolis, Maryland has several shows throughout the year. Starting in April they host a Spring Sailboat Show (April 26-28<sup>th</sup>), part of which includes Cruisers University, a great feature for new boaters to get you ready for boating season.  In the fall however is when the big shows happen- The United States Powerboat Show, October 3<sup>rd</sup>-6<sup>th</sup>, followed by the United States Sailboat Show from October 10<sup>th</sup>-14<sup>th</sup>.    The Powerboat Show boasts the honor of being the nations largest in-water powerboat exhibition and includes an Antique and Classic boat portion.  The Sailboat show is recognized worldwide as the premier sailing showcase- the place to buy, sell or dream! More information on all of these events can be found at <a href="http://www.usboat.com/">www.usboat.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/annapolis-show.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" id="i-233" alt="Image" src="http://boathistoryreport.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/annapolis-show.jpg?w=390" width="390" height="289" /></a></p>
<p> Boat Shows are the best way to get an idea of what is on the market in the way of newest technology, design, and trends.  They are not only fun to walk around, but a great way to learn.  They typically offer classes geared towards safer boating and best practices while on the water and many of these are free.  If you are at all serious about boating and being a boat owner, attending some of these boat shows is a must, and also the perfect way to spend your Saturday afternoon (unless you’re on a boat, of course!).</p>

<p>It is great to see boaters getting back on their feet after Sandy.  We cannot imagine the devastation that Hurricane Sandy Victims have faced and although their lives will never be the same, it is encouraging to see people picking up the pieces and pushing forward.  Thank you Katie Little for a great article in CNBC..</p>
<h1><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100355497">In Sandy&#8217;s Aftermath, Hope for Higher Boat Sales</a></h1>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>Fresh off the boating industry&#8217;s first significant sales increase since the recession, dealers are seeing a boost in traffic in the aftermath of super storm Sandy&#8217;s destruction as consumers begin their search for replacement boats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a rush right after Sandy because there were people who were actively starting to look to replace their boats even though they had not been actually called a totaled loss, but they anticipated that, so they started shopping early,&#8221; said Dick Curry, a salesman at Staten Island Yacht Sales. &#8220;And we are feeling a surge of people making phone calls to replace their boats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flurry of Sandy-related traffic comes as the U.S. boating industry has finally started to see the tide turn for sales growth. Last year, sales grew an estimated 10 percent after a tepid three-point rise in 2011, according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association.</p>
<p>This increase follows a sharp decline in new boat sales during the recession when sales dropped by nearly half. Pre-owned boat sales fared better, resulting in only about a 15-percent sales drop during the period.</p>

<p>In response to the sales decline, manufacturers began to place more emphasis on building boats only when dealers ordered them to cut back on inventory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, dealer inventories were pretty lean,&#8221; said Thom Dammrich, the association&#8217;s president. He added, they will probably increase inventories following a good 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year I think there are probably going to be more boats available in inventory, but it&#8217;s still going to be buy now if you want it available in spring,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Boat sales last year were driven by an improvement in economic conditions, including consumer confidence and the housing market, as well as growing interest in recreational boating and new, more affordable, boat designs. While these trends should continue, Sandy&#8217;s destruction is also expected to spur sales.</p>
<p>The storm destroyed or damaged more than 65,000 recreational boats, resulting in losses of about $650 million, according to the Boat Owner&#8217;s Association of the United States — the worst since the group began keeping track in 1966.</p>
<p>The traffic boost that dealers have reported seeing so far because of Sandy is not without precedent.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look back at Hurricane Katrina in 2005, we saw sales in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi spike about 30 percent for new boats and boat parts and accessories,&#8221; Dammrich said.</p>
<p><strong>Boat Show Season Kicks Off</strong></p>
<p>At the Progressive New York Boat Show, dealers and prospective buyers, still reeling from Sandy&#8217;s damage, browsed the latest offerings. Dealers rely on these events to drum up business since typically, anywhere from 40 to 60 percent of sales result from orders at the boat shows or leads that stem from them.</p>
<p>One such visitor, Jim Gennosa, an electrician from Oceanside, N.Y., came to the show with friends to see the boats after losing one of his own during the storm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The larger one was a 33-foot Coastal Wellcraft, and we took that out of the water the night before the storm, figured it would be safer on land, but found out the next day, the marina, all of the docks and half the building were gone,&#8221; Gennosa said. &#8220;So the boat was totaled. We found it in somebody&#8217;s yard about a half of a mile away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gennosa&#8217;s other boat, a 25-footer he&#8217;s owned for more than two decades, was tied to a floating dock behind his house and weathered the storm well.</p>
<p>Since Gennosa&#8217;s insurance company has already reimbursed him for his destroyed boat, he&#8217;s in the market for a new boat again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking around for another larger one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I can get a good deal — a real good deal — I&#8217;ll buy one. If I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deal hunters, like Gennosa, are in luck. To spur sales, manufacturers are offering a wide range of incentives, according to dealers in the Sandy-strickened Northeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them, we are doubling the cash incentives,&#8221; said Matthew Barbara, MarineMax&#8217;s regional president for the New York City area. &#8220;Some of them, we are giving slips. We are just trying to be as creative as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although MarineMax failed to turn a profit from 2009 to 2011 due to high inventory and high expenses, Barbara said it was able to stop &#8220;the slide down&#8221; last year as consumer confidence picked up. But he said the lack of settlement checks for some customers has been an issue.</p>
<p><strong>The Waiting Game</strong></p>
<p>For boat owners who haven&#8217;t received insurance checks yet, the incentives may not be enough to spark a sale yet. Although Barbara said his company has not seen a Sandy boost yet, he forecast that there will be an uptick down the road once people settle their claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of them are still waiting for their boat&#8217;s condition reports to come back from the adjusters and to get their settlements from the insurance companies,&#8221; Curry said.</p>
<p>For those whose boats are not totaled, Curry foresees many headaches due to a surge in repair orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;We quite frankly are not prepared for that kind of a surge because the economy itself has caused us to lay off quite a few people — many of whom have gone out and found other jobs so there&#8217;s going to be a big wait on the average consumer&#8217;s part as a boater to get their boat fixed because there are just not a lot of people around,&#8221; Curry said.</p>
<p>Additionally, the service departments at many dealers and marinas have been wiped out due to the storm, adding further pressure to the industry&#8217;s ability to service repairs.</p>
<p>Once Sandy-damaged boats do get repaired, many will eventually make their way to the pre-owned market. Before paying for these boats, Dammrich urged buyers to hire a boat surveyor to examine potential purchases to see if they are sound again.</p>
<p>&#8220;That person can tell you if the boat was damaged and repaired and scan and tell you if there are any problems with the systems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Particularly now in the Northeast, buying a pre-owned boat without a boat survey would be ill-advised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the repair worker shortage, there is good news for the boating industry sales ahead if the NMMA&#8217;s forecasts prove true. The association predicts sales will rise<strong> </strong>by 5 to 10 percent this year provided the economic conditions continue to improve and there is a sustained increase in outdoor recreation participation.</p>
<p>Although Northeast enthusiasts have been tested by Sandy&#8217;s devastation, Staten Island Yacht Sales&#8217; Curry also sees a bright side to the damage.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always somebody who benefits from somebody else&#8217;s losses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve lost a lot. Our industry has, and we as individuals, we as a company have lost a tremendous amount of money — and us being able to help people replace their boats helps us be able to replace the money that we&#8217;ve lost. So there&#8217;s kind of a silver lining to a dark cloud.&#8221;</p>
