1. something wrong in switch_Heb_Translit_1_14_3
	1.	Both out_main_html.html and out_main_js.js have errors on 1:14 line 3
	2. 	There is 16 words in that verse
	3.	It get's stuck on ul'ya'mim on javascript, ("15th word"). 
		Then it writes switch_Heb_Translit_1_14_3 for remaining two words
		1. it ended the function, started a new one for 16th word and didn't end it	
	4.	It gets stuck on וְּשָּנִׁים on html ("16th last word"). then it writes a bad div
	5. 	It's not printing out exactly 8 words and I think thats the problem




///////////Thoughts Version 1////////////////////////////////

Main problems with output of my code
	A.	None of the js is working
	1.	##fixed## The chapter and verse doesn't show up
	2.	There isn't an orderly heb-->eng-->heb--> structure as expected
		A.	This is obvious in the code. I'm writting a loop for the hebrew verse and a loop for the english verse.
	##fixed kind of##3. 	The Divs dont stay all the way to the right .. wtf?
	4. 	Everything has quotations

Things I'm noticing about the .html file
	1.	line 74(וְּרוּחַַ) is second hebrew div when it's suppost to be english
		A.	This is obvious in the code. I'm writting a loop for the hebrew verse and a loop for the english verse.
	##fixed##2.	line 87(and~the~LAND) starts a new div wrapper without closing the old one I also notice it goes back to Eng.

Things I fixed
	2.	line 87(and~the~LAND) starts a new div wrapper without closing the old one I also notice it goes back to Eng.
		A. something wrong in main_html_python.py line_53 if index2%32 == 0 && index2 != 0 its not writing the end to the div when it's suppost to
		F. changed main_html_python.py
			#exit inner for loop
			#Last line did NOT have exactly 8 words
			if index3%32 != 0:
